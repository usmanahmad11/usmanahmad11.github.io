## My personal site!

This repository is used to host [my personal site](https://friscolt.github.io), where you can find general information about my work, a brief CV, 
my research progress and some important news.

The base theme of the personal site is [minimal theme](https://pages-themes.github.io/minimal/), which is available on the github pages. One of the personal pages used as inspiration is the site of [Shuangning Li](https://lsn235711.github.io/index.html). I recently added a [coffee](https://friscolt.github.io/coffee) section. This section is inspired by pages of researchers ([Tejaswi Kasarla](https://tkasarla.github.io/more.html), [Justine Sherry](http://www.justinesherry.com/coffee.html), and [Akshay Narayan](https://akshayn.xyz/coffee.html)), who love coffee as much as I do.

If you want to use this same style, you can clone the repository and edit it. 

Cheers, [Francisco](https://twitter.com/Friscolt)
