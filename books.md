### Books

The vast majority of the books I have read are in Spanish. My love for literature was born when I met a great friend, Pablo. I share with you a list of my top favorite books I have read since then: 

**Top favorite books**

* Tokio blues, *Haruki Murakami* (more readed, **favorite book ever**)
* Persona normal, *Benito Taibo* (everyone child in the world must be read it)
* The Martian, *Andy Weir* (sarcastic, **awesome stupid**, and genius)
* La tregua, *Mario Benedetti* (a warm hug in the heart)
