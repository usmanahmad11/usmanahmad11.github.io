### Inspiration 

Coffee recomendation section is **inspired** by pages of **researchers** ([Tejaswi Kasarla](https://tkasarla.github.io/more.html), [Justine Sherry](http://www.justinesherry.com/coffee.html), and [Akshay Narayan](https://akshayn.xyz/coffee.html)), who **love coffee** as much as I do. It is amazing to find personal pages that worship **scientific research, and coffee**.

### How do I brew my coffee?

I usually buy freshly roasted seeds at my local store, then I grind the **coffee at home** and finally, I prepare (mainly) **expresso coffee** in expresso machine, or **moka pot**. When I prepare american coffee, I do it in the chemex or french press. Sometimes I order coffee online, I highly **recommend** [Carajillo](https://www.carajillocafe.com) coffee, and also I go to STARBUCKS for a bag of [CHIAPAS](https://www.starbucks.com.mx/promo/Chiapas). Recently, I'm in love of *affogato*, a mixed of vanilla ice and a expreso. Wonderful!

### Favorite coffee roasters

* [Café de Mi Abuelo](https://www.instagram.com/cafedemiabuelocholula/) (San Pedro Cholula), has **the best marago** crop. It is a mild coffee, it lifts your spirits, and *every grain is life.*
* [Café Tres Gallos](https://www.instagram.com/cafe3gallos/) (Puebla), has one of **the best house blend** of the city. Although it is a little strong (**be careful**), it has an **incredible flavor**.
* [Taller de espresso](https://www.instagram.com/tallerdeespresso/?hl=es) (Guadalajara), I love to shop here because it smells like good coffee grains. Plus, they have grains from different parts of Mexico. I recommend it.



###  Favorite coffee shops


I'm currently in **Guadalajara** and have found the following coffee shops that I can recommend:

* [Ahuehuete Americana](https://www.instagram.com/ahuehuete.gdl/?hl=es) (Guadalajara). It was love at first sight, like magic. I could say that it is my favorite coffee shop in all of Guadalajara. It is a place full of plants, and coffee shop. 
* [Guter](https://www.instagram.com/gutercoffeebread/?hl=es) (Zapopan). I really like this coffee shop because it is surrounded by many trees. The atmosphere is nice to spend the afternoon and wait for the sunset. 
* [Café 5PM](https://www.instagram.com/cafe5pm/?hl=es) (Zapopan). I have only visited it at night and it was magical. Perhaps one of the places I will remember most in Guadalajara. 




The following list is a tour of the coffee shops you must visit if you ever come to **Puebla**: 

* My **favorite coffee shop** is [Café de Mi Abuelo](https://www.instagram.com/cafedemiabuelocholula/) (San Pedro Cholula). An excellent place to work, visit Laila (the owner), or spend an afternoon chatting with friends. *It has become my refuge and it is like being at home*. If you love **cappuccino**, order one with cajeta and thank me later.
* If you are in the *"Barrio de los sapos",* you can visit [Café Santo Patrono](https://www.instagram.com/cafesantopatrono/) (Puebla). It has it all: a **beautiful place**, the best playlist, excellent coffee and **the best chocolate cake I've ever tasted**.
* Hidden in a a small place of Puebla, [Manos Artesanales](https://es-la.facebook.com/manosartesanalesam) (Santa María **Tonantzintla**) is a coffee shop with a **beautiful garden** (plants, lights and sounds).  It is a place that I don't know how to describe with words.
* I have such good memories in [Café Milagros](https://www.instagram.com/cafemilagrospuebla/) (Puebla) that I can only tell you: go! The place is **beautiful and very traditional**, just around the corner from [Café Santo Patrono](https://www.instagram.com/cafesantopatrono/) in the heart of the city. 
* [Café-Tal](https://www.instagram.com/cafetal_cholula/) and [Las Duyas](https://www.instagram.com/churrerialasduyas/) in the heart of San Pedro Cholula  are a couple of coffee shops you must visit in **my dear town**.
* [Terraza Museo Amparo](https://museoamparo.com/cafe) (Puebla) is perfect. You can visit the museum or go to work in the library, then go up to the terrace. Enjoy the view of the Cathedral and the **domes of the city**, it is **superb!**
